/**
 * Texture loader for the 1.14+ painting back texture.
 * <p>
 * In 1.13 and earlier, this used to be a 64x64 texture from the paintings texture atlas. Starting
 * with 1.14, it is a 16x16 texture that then gets tiled as needed. For easier usage in Chunky, this
 * loader does the tiling so {@link Texture#paintingBack} always has the size of a 4x4 blocks
 * picture frame regardless of the resource pack version.
